## General Information
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors
looking to lend money and make a return.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the
applicantâ€™s profile.
Our objective is to identify predictors of default so that at the time of loan application, we can use
those variables for approval/rejection of the loan.

- Dataset used is loan.csv.
It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
